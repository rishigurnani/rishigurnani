### Hi there, I'm Rishi ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a PhD student working on computational materials science in the [Ramprasad Group](https://ramprasad.mse.gatech.edu/dr-ramprasad/) at Georgia Tech. My open source work is split between my personal GitHub profile and the [Ramprasad Group's GitHub profile](https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group). Some of my contributions in the latter profile include:
- [Linker SMILES Extractor (LSE)](https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/LSE): Linker SMILES Extractor is a codebase that allows a user to return the SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings of an input Metal Organic Frameworkâ€™s constituent linkers.
